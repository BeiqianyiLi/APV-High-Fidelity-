## Disclaimer
This project is an independent open-source conceptual prototype created solely for the CraterHacks 404 Hackathon. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Apple Inc., or any mentioned co-branded entities (Rolex, Porsche, etc.). 

## Project Overview
Built for "Experiencers" (consumers seeking novelty and social identity), this high-fidelity interactive prototype explores the future of spatial computing e-commerce. 

### Key Features:
- **True 3D Rendering**: Real-time manipulation of a highly detailed Apple Vision Pro .glb model.
- **Dynamic Pricing Engine**: A complex JavaScript calculator that instantly updates the total price based on hardware and software customizations.
- **EyeSight Display Modes**: An innovative proposal for customizable external displays (Privacy Mirror & Cyber-Aura) to address user privacy and social expression pain points.

## Tech Stack
- HTML5 / CSS3 / Vanilla JavaScript
